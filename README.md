‚óè /user/register - Create a user account using username / password

‚óè /user/logout - Discard the JWT Token used for logging in to the system

‚óè /tasks/createTask - Upload a new task to fetch latest tweets for the hashtag - #Bangalore

‚óè /tasks/listTask - List out all the tasks which were executed successfully/scheduled to be queued, and
provide the metadata, such as how much time did it take to execute, status code, number of tweets
fetched. Ignore for tasks, which are not completed

‚óè /tasks/completedTask - List out the tasks which are completed. Same as /tasks/listTask but shows only
